* About

The only purpose of =xdpyprobe= program is to probe the X server for
connectivity.  The idea of this program came from [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/637005/x-server-running][this SO question]].

The result of probing can be obtained either from an output or from the
exit status (0 - connection is possible, 1 - it is not).  The output may
be suppressed with =--quiet= option.

* Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ xdpyprobe
DISPLAY ':0' is available?  yes
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ xdpyprobe :3
DISPLAY ':3' is available?  no
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ DISPLAY=:2 xdpyprobe -q ; echo $?
1
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ xdpyprobe -h
... <some useful info> ...
#+END_SRC

* Building from Git

Requirements for building from git:

- [[http://gnu.org/software/autoconf/][GNU Autoconf]]
- [[http://gnu.org/software/automake/][GNU Automake]]
- [[http://gnu.org/software/help2man/][GNU Help2man]]

Run =./autogen.sh= to generate the build system infrastructure.  After
that, the program can be built and installed with the usual sequence of
commands of the GNU Build System:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./configure
make
make install
#+END_SRC
